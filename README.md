### Getting started

You gotta install everything, so

```
npm install
```

then you want to build the stuff, so:

```
grunt
```

or, if you want to get fancy,

```
grunt watch
```

You'll need to create a `twitter-credentials.json` file that looks like `twitter-credentials.example.json`, but with actual info in there.

Finally, to get this running locally, you'll need to do:

```
npm run start
```
